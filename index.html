			<h1>Hi, I'm Emilie :)</h1>
			<img src="images/profile-picture.jpg" class="img-circle" width="130px" alt="Emilie Brito Barreira">
			<p>
				I am a French third-year BBA student at ESSEC, and I did my exchange semester in LUISS Guido Carli in Rome, Italy. 🇫🇷 🇮🇹<br /> Born on July 23rd, 2003, I'm a proud Leo! ♌🪐 <br /> Passionate about luxury fashion and emerging technologies, I'd like to pursue a career allying both tech and luxury! <br />
				<br />
				Below is a link to one of my favorite website, Pinterest. I like it because you can always find some inspo for outfits, drawings or even travel bucket lists.🦋💐🌆<br />

			<h2> Tutoring for Scool&Co ESSEC Organization</h2>
			<p>
				Scool&Co is an extra tutoring association for underprivileged children in Cergy.🧸<br /> During my second year, I occupied the Head Communications position, and I had to manage a team of 3 people to develop an effective communication strategy on social media platforms to promote our actions.💌

			<h2>My hobbies</h2>
			<p>
				Passionate about the cinema industry, I love watching the latest movies in theater with friends or family. Besides, 3 of my favorite movies ever are Interstellar, Inception, and The Great Gatsby. I love how movies can convey such a range of diverse emotions, either through storytelling, or even beautiful aesthetics.🎬 <br />
				<br />
				I am also keen on traveling, as I've already been to several EU countries, such as Germany, Portugal, and Italy. Furthermore, at the end of my 6-month exchange, I organized a 2-week city trip to visit countries I've never been to before, like Budapest, Hungary, and Vienna, Austria; as well as different Italian cities (Firenze, Napoli, etc.).🌎<br />

			<h2>My project</h2>
			<p>
				Considering my interest for luxury fashion and leather goods, as well as emerging technologies such as the Metaverse, I would love to work in a company that merges both of my passions.✨ <br />
				Indeed, I admire the works of the most talented Houses, such as Dior, Chanel, Saint Laurent or even Mugler, and I think that going digital is the best way for luxury brands to continue talking about their craftsmanship and heritage, especially to future generations. <br />
				Furthermore, I discovered that I was interested in the tech industry through my previous work experiences, as well as projects I conducted during ESSEC and my exchange semester. 👩‍💻 <br />
